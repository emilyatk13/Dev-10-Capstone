For our dashboard, we utilized Plotlyâ€™s Dash in combination with Bootstrapping to create a viewable webpage. Dropdown menus, interactive graphs, and pre-run visuals then populate using Dash's Python library. For deployment of the dashboard, download all files as-is from the DashBoard folder. Inside the DashBoard folder, there is a folder called DashBoard-data. Do not unpack this folder, leave the folder as-is inside the DashBoard folder. The dashboard requires a config.py file with sensitive information. Please contact the owner of this github and request access. The config.py file contains all SQL table databases and variables for your own SQL username, SQL password, server, and port connected to the entire database.

To deploy the dashboard, run the DashBoard.py file, do not closed the terminal, and paste the url given to you in the terminal. The url should be http://127.0.0.1:8050/ and will only run if the application is open and active in the terminal.
