# Paycheck Protection Programs (PPP): Loan decision analysis led by data

As the global pandemic COVID 19 hit the U.S. Economy in 2019, the United States government implemented an unprecedented and large-scale solution to keep businesses (and by extension, their employees) afloat. The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP), which ran from March 2020 through April 2021, allowed businesses to take out loans backed by the federal government. The government intended for these loans to keep businesses solvent and employees on their payroll during the span of the pandemic.
We seek to provide an analysis that the government can apply should there ever be a need to implement something like the Paycheck Protection Program again. We will start with some exploratory research, aiming to understand what this program looked like in practice. In order to contextualize the impact of the PPP, we will also analyze contemporaneous unemployment data. From there, we will implement predictive modeling of data from the PPP to determine key factors in forecasting which borrowers will pay their loans. Our main questions that will guide this research are below.

## Essential Questions
1. What types of business owners (gender, race, geography) received Paycheck Protection Program loans? 
2. Which industries (based on Census NAICS codes) received the largest amount of loans?
3. How did businesses in each state and industry use the loans they received?  
4. Was the quantity of loans given proportional to the demographic breakdown of business in each state/industry?
5. Which businesses in each state/industry paid off their loans? Which businesses had their loans forgiven?
6. Who were the top lenders to businesses in each state and industry?
7. What is the relationship between the number of PPP loans given by state and that stateâ€™s unemployment numbers?
8. Based on predictive modeling analysis, how likely is a particular business to pay back their loan?

## Data Structure & ETL
A comprehensive guide of our ETL process can be found at [here](ProjectSpecifications/RepeatableETLReport.pdf), All data has been collected from U.S. Government agencies to ensure credibility. Information regarding the PPP has been obtained from the Small Business Administration. Information regarding the Business/Business Owner Demographics have been obtained from the Census Annual Business Survey. Information regarding Uemployment has been obtained from the Department of Labor Statistics. More information on these datasets can be found [here](#Datasets).

After retrieving all relevant data for our research from these U.S. departments, we then begin the process of transformation to populate our SQL database. Our transformation of the data utilized Python Pandas & Apache Spark. General Transformation practices included removing null values, dropping unnecessary columns, removing aggregations already present so as to not skew our results, converting data into an appropriate type, and renaming columns for clarity. For the PPP datasets, we made the decision to combine the 13 csv files into a larger single csv so as it could be called upon more reliably. With transformation of the data completed, we then deploy all the data into our SQL Database through the use of Spark Databricks.

  7. `CensusInfo`: This table contains a `StateID` foreign key referencing the `State` table, an `IndustryID` foreign key referencing the `Industry` table, a `DemographicID` foreign key referencing the `DemographicInfo` table, and the `NumberOfBusinesses` that references the total number of businesses that are located wihin a particular `CensusID`.
  8. `PPPBorrower`: This table contains information from the PPP dataset including: `BorrowerName` representing the name of the individual or business that applied for the loan, `CensusID` foreign key referencing the `CensusInfo` table, `BusinessAgeDescID` foreign key referencing the `BusinessAgeDescription` table, `JobsReported` which represents the number of employees within the applicants business, `BusinessTypeID` foreign key referencing the `BusinessType` table, `HubzoneIndicator` which represents whether a business is within a 'Historically Underutilized Business Zone', and `LMIIndicator` which represents whether the business classifies within a 'Low-and-Moderate Income' community.
  9. `PPPLender`: This table contains information from the PPP dataset including: `ServicingLenderName` which represents the institution that currently holds the loan given to a particular business, and `OriginatingLenderName` which represents the institution that initally held the loan at the time of loan approval.

## Machine Learning
Throughout our analysis of the PPP data, we anchored our focus around what happened during the loan program. Who received the loans, how did they use it, was there a connection to unemployment rates? For machine learning, we shifted from focusing on what the loan program was like in practice to how to optimize future implementation of a similar program. Our group created a model that predicts whether or not a borrower will pay back their loan based on key information including the industry, age of the business, and the demographics of the owner. We ran an algorithm with 'K Nearest Neighbors' using sklearn with the goal of producing the fewest false positives as lenders are risk averse. Should the United States ever run such a program again, the implementation of our model would allow them to select borrowers most likely to pay back their loans. Our full Machine Learning code with information comments can be found [here](code/PPP_ml_implementation.ipynb). 

## Visualization


The visualizations in the dashboard are created using both Plotly Express and Plotly Graph Objects. Plotly Express is used for it's native integration with Dash, a product created by Plotly. For any visualizations made outside of the Dash environment we have imported them as PNG files to be placed within the layout of the Dash page. For the graphs dynamically updated on pages, we chose to take the userâ€™s dropdown input to call the relevant information from the Pandas DataFrames, which we then transformed into Plotly visualizations.

## Dash Deployment

For our dashboard, we utilized Plotlyâ€™s Dash in combination with Bootstrapping to create a viewable webpage. Dropdown menus, interactive graphs, and pre-run visuals then populate using Dash's Python library. For deployment of the dashboard, download all files as-is from the DashBoard folder. Inside the DashBoard folder, there is a folder called DashBoard-data. Do not unpack this folder, leave the folder as-is inside the DashBoard folder. The dashboard requires a config.py file with sensitive information. Please contact the owner of this github and request access. The config.py file contains all SQL table databases and variables for your own SQL username, SQL password, server, and port connected to the entire database.

To deploy the dashboard, run the DashBoard_Code.py file using the terminal command `python DashBoard_Code.py` in the root folder, do not closed the terminal, then copy and paste the url given to you in the terminal to a web broweser. The url should be `http://127.0.0.1:8050/` and will only run if the application is open and active in the terminal.

## Heroku

From our dashboard we utilized the cloud platorm Heroku to create a web app allowing easier access to our dahsboard at any time using the link: https://ppp-loans-dashboard.herokuapp.com/. Heroku is a cloud platform that lets companies and developers build, deliver, monitor and scale apps which is the fastest way to go from idea to URL, bypassing all those infrastructure headaches. 
To help set up this app we used the <a herf =https://www.youtube.com/c/CharmingData>Charming Data</a> Youtube channel instructional video <a herf=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-M2KQ6_bM4>Deploy your First App with Heroku and Dash Plotly</a> which provided helpful step-by-step procedures to enable the web app.
